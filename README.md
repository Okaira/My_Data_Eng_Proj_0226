# AFCON Data Cleaning Pipeline
This branch contains the data cleaning workflow for the AFCON dataset.  
The goal is to transform raw match, team, and player data into a clean, analysis-ready format.

## Objectives

- Standardize team and player names
- Normalize date and time formats
- Remove duplicates
- Validate match statistics
- Prepare structured tables for downstream analytics

## Folder Structure
- `BlackStone/` — Raw and intermediate data files
- `scripts/` — Python cleaning scripts (to be added)
- `notebooks/` — Exploratory cleaning and validation notebooks

## Next Steps
- Add initial cleaning script
- Validate cleaned dataset
- Prepare for merge into `main`
